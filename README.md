# airplane-repair-ethereum

This project is a prototype of airplanes repair system using ethereum blockchain. The main idea of developing a descentralized app is to store all the transactions and tasks done during the process of repair, promoting auditability.


Developed during my computer science masters at Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo, 2020.


Pre-requisites: node.js, npm, truffle, ganache, metamask.

Terminal commands to reproduce:
